          My name is Abigail Wezelis, and I am a twenty-something undergrad pursuing a Computer Engineering major and French Language minor at the University of Pittsburgh. I am from Webster, New York, where I graduated from Webster Thomas High School as the Class of 2014 Valedictorian. Some highlights of my high school career included competing in the Odyssey of the Mind World Finals three times and playing first-chair trumpet twice in the Monroe County All-County Band.

          It became clear during my early teenage years that I was indeed never going to receive my Hogwarts letter, so I contented myself with the thought of instead attending university to study STEM, perhaps the next-best thing to wizardry. Since coming to Pitt, I have taken many challenging and worthwhile classes, such as Electronic Circuits, Computer Organization, and Algorithms, just to name a few. Outside of academics, I am the Vice President of the University Handbell Ensemble and often attend meetings for Pitt's Chapter of IEEE. You can also find me at many of the Pitt football games cheering on the Pitt Panthers at Heinz Stadium.

          For the past two summers, I have had the experience of a lifetime working at Camp Good Days, a summer camp for children whose lives have been touched by cancer and other life challenges. As the camp's Music & Drama Specialist, I have had the opportunity to run drum circles, recorder lessons, talent shows, and other music-related activities, as well as work as a part-time lifeguard. The people that I have met while working at Camp Good Days-- coworkers, volunteers, and most of all the campers-- are some of the most kind and courageous people out there.

          This past summer, I also had the opportunity to study abroad for 5 weeks at INSA Lyon, in Lyon, France, where I took two classes: one on the Internet of Things and another on French Culture.  While abroad, I also had the opportunity to travel to Paris, Annecy, Chamonix, Geneva, Marseille, and Barcelona.

          My interest in Computer Engineering stems from my love for science and math, and I am very eager and excited to see where my career takes me.  Already, I have had the opportunity to work as a software development co-op in the Meshing Development Unit at ANSYS.  This was a great learning experience, and I look forward to returning there to work future co-op rotations.
